# Points of action

 

- Fixed errors during signup 

- Reduced amount of server calls

- Logging in actually checks for the password now

- improved keyboard controls of sign up

- Users can now see their reservations in a table

- BuildingCards are generated dynamically from actual instances from the DB and reservations should be more consistent

- Finished the reservation Manager controller.
- Created tests for all entities on client side and changed some incorrect endpoints.

- Maik: wasn’t feeling well the last couple of days so moved stuff to next week’s sprint (testing of controllers on backend). Did implement some more endpoints on the backend.

- Created the UI and controller for an admin to manage the users. Admin can see all users and delete a selected user

- Team’s deadline was week 7.5, probably not going to reach that. What have we implemented already (from the requirements originally given)?

- What do we still need to implement?

- When are we going to start working on the report? Who will work on it?

- How are we going to deal with the video presentation?
